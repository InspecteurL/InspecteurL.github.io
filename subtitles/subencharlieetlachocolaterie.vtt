NARRATOR: This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.964
...named Charlie Bucket.

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:28.178
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.934
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:38.897
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.360
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:46.905
He just didn't know it yet.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.507
-Evening, Buckets.
-Evening.

CHARLlE:
Hi, Dad.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.471
Soup's almost ready, darling.

00:05:12.056 --> 00:05:15.308
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:18.770
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:24.776
Charlie...

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:27.695
...l found something l think you'll like.

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:35.203
NARRATOR: Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.415
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:44.420
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:48.424
It's exactly what l need.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:51.052
What is it, Charlie?

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:59.602
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.772
-What piece was it?
-A head for Willy Wonka.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.190
Well, how wonderful.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:06.401
It's quite a likeness.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.236
CHARLlE: You think so?
-Think so?

00:06:08.404 --> 00:06:09.988
I know so.

00:06:10.155 --> 00:06:13.825
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:16.286
-l used to work for him, you know.
-You did?

00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:17.996
-l did.
-He did.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.455
He did.

00:06:19.623 --> 00:06:21.624
I love grapes.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.170
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:32.218
GRANDPA JOE: Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:35.680
But the whole world wanted his candy.

00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:41.394
-Mr. Wonka.
-Yeah?

00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:43.354
We need more Wonka bars...

00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:47.358
-...and we're out of chocolate birds.
-Birds?

00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:48.985
Birds.

00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:53.197
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:57.535
Now open.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:03.791
The man was a genius.

00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:08.630
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

00:07:08.797 --> 00:07:12.467
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:17.138
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:21.184
-But that's impossible.
-But Willy Wonka did it.

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:25.563
GRANDPA JOE:
Before long...

00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:29.275
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:32.528
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:35.990
Fifty times as big as any other.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.678
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

00:07:57.763 --> 00:08:01.557
Tell him about the lndian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:04.394
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:09.357
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:12.235
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:17.031
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.367
[LAUGHS]

00:08:20.244 --> 00:08:21.703
WONKA:
It will have 1 00 rooms...

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.499
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:32.964
GRANDPA JOE: True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:35.883
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:39.929
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:44.684
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

00:08:44.852 --> 00:08:47.770
It is perfect in every way.

00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:51.065
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:55.028
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:58.531
I intend to live in it.

00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:03.786
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:09.625
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.879
Mmm.

00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:21.512
[LAUGHS]

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:50.541
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:53.503
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

00:09:55.506 --> 00:10:00.384
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

00:10:00.552 --> 00:10:05.348
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:37.213
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:41.759
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:44.720
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:47.890
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:51.018
The thievery got so bad...

00:10:51.186 --> 00:10:53.354
...that one day, without warning...

00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:58.067
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:03.072
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.451
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:08.911
I'm sorry.

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:28.639
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:33.060
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time."

00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:36.939
Such as, "l feel like l've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever."

00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:40.776
-Now, Pops.
-The factory did close, Charlie.

00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:44.947
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:49.785
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:53.831
-The factory was back in business.
-Did you get your job back?

00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:56.125
No.

00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:58.127
No one did.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.424
But there must be
people working there.

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:07.136
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:09.972
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:14.352
No. The gates are always closed.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.187
Exactly.

00:12:16.772 --> 00:12:18.856
But then, who's running the machines?

00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:21.984
-Nobody knows, Charlie.
-lt certainly is a mystery.

00:12:22.694 --> 00:12:24.487
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.200
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:34.288
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:36.999
...already packed and addressed.

00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:42.588
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:46.842
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:51.389
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

00:12:51.848 --> 00:12:55.518
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

close as any of us is ever going to get.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.059
Put these on quick, and don't
take them off whatever you do.

01:24:31.727 --> 01:24:34.646
This light could burn your eyeballs
right out of your skulls.

01:24:34.981 --> 01:24:37.941
And we certainly don't want that,
now, do we?

01:24:40.778 --> 01:24:44.489
This is the testing room for my
very latest and greatest invention:

01:24:44.907 --> 01:24:47.367
Television Chocolate.

01:24:47.535 --> 01:24:48.785
One day it occurred to me:

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:51.538
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

01:24:51.706 --> 01:24:55.750
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces
and send it whizzing through the air...

01:24:55.918 --> 01:24:57.836
...then reassemble it
on the other end...

01:24:58.004 --> 01:25:00.005
...why can't l do the same
with chocolate?

01:25:00.464 --> 01:25:03.300
Why can't l send a real bar
of chocolate...

01:25:03.467 --> 01:25:05.844
...through the television,
all ready to be eaten?"

01:25:06.012 --> 01:25:09.764
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction.

01:25:11.183 --> 01:25:12.434
MR. TEAVEE:
Sounds impossible.

01:25:12.893 --> 01:25:14.227
MlKE:
It is impossible.

01:25:15.187 --> 01:25:17.856
You don't understand anything
about science.

01:25:18.024 --> 01:25:23.111
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles. Duh.

01:25:23.279 --> 01:25:26.865
Second, the amount of power it
would take to convert energy in matter...

01:25:27.199 --> 01:25:28.825
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

01:25:29.035 --> 01:25:30.493
Mumbler!

01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:35.332
Seriously, l cannot understand
a single word you're saying.

01:25:38.919 --> 01:25:40.378
Okey-dokey.

01:25:40.546 --> 01:25:43.882
I shall now send a bar of chocolate
from one end of the room...

01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:47.135
...to the other by television.

01:25:47.303 --> 01:25:48.720
Bring in the chocolate.

01:26:09.492 --> 01:26:12.160
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

01:26:12.328 --> 01:26:15.705
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

01:26:15.873 --> 01:26:17.290
Same basic principle.

01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:50.865
It's gone.

01:26:51.826 --> 01:26:55.954
Told you. That chocolate is now rushing
through the air above our heads...

01:26:56.122 --> 01:26:58.581
...in a million tiny little pieces.

01:26:58.791 --> 01:27:01.626
Come over here.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

01:27:07.216 --> 01:27:08.967
Watch the screen.

01:27:12.346 --> 01:27:13.972
Here it comes.

01:27:15.057 --> 01:27:16.641
Oh, look.

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:23.440
-Take it.
-lt's just a picture on a screen.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.650
Scaredy-cat.

01:27:25.818 --> 01:27:27.318
You take it.

01:27:28.154 --> 01:27:30.447
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

01:27:38.622 --> 01:27:40.123
Go on.

01:27:48.132 --> 01:27:49.966
Holy buckets.

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:55.096
Eat it. Go on.

01:27:55.264 --> 01:27:57.432
It'll be delicious. lt's the same bar.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.894
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

01:28:09.236 --> 01:28:10.737
It's great.

01:28:10.905 --> 01:28:12.280
It's a miracle.

01:28:14.074 --> 01:28:16.910
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

01:28:17.077 --> 01:28:20.830
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

01:28:20.998 --> 01:28:25.084
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

01:28:25.252 --> 01:28:28.171
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself."

01:28:29.173 --> 01:28:32.759
And you simply reach out and take it.

01:28:33.677 --> 01:28:34.969
How about that?

01:28:35.137 --> 01:28:37.055
So can you send other things?

01:28:37.223 --> 01:28:39.015
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

01:28:39.391 --> 01:28:41.976
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

01:28:42.144 --> 01:28:45.480
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

01:28:45.648 --> 01:28:47.774
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

01:28:48.067 --> 01:28:50.068
-Of course l could.
-What about people?

01:28:50.444 --> 01:28:53.947
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

01:28:54.114 --> 01:28:57.325
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

01:28:57.535 --> 01:29:00.495
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

01:29:00.663 --> 01:29:02.831
And all you think about is chocolate.

01:29:02.998 --> 01:29:04.207

what he's talking about.

No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

01:29:09.922 --> 01:29:12.048

but he's an idiot.

But l'm not.

01:29:19.431 --> 01:29:20.932
Hey, little boy.

01:29:22.226 --> 01:29:23.935

Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.276
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

01:30:13.485 --> 01:30:14.694
What do you mean?

01:30:15.154 --> 01:30:19.574
Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

01:30:20.743 --> 01:30:24.203
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

01:30:24.496 --> 01:30:26.414
What kind of a question is that?

01:30:27.207 --> 01:30:30.293
No need to snap. Just a question.

01:30:31.128 --> 01:30:34.088
