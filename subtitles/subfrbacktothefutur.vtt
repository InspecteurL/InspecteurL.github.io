This is a radiation suit.

Radiation suit?

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:39.489
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

(EXCLAIMS)

00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:40.133
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore,

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.969
but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.

Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

00:53:46.639 --> 00:53:47.640
Whoa, whoa.

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:52.145
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in 1985.

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:54.439
-I got a girl.
-Is she pretty?

00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:58.943
Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me.

00:53:59.026 --> 00:54:03.322
Look at this. Look what she wrote here, Doc.
I mean, that says it all.

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:07.160
Doc, you're my only hope.

00:54:07.827 --> 00:54:11.164
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:14.667
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

00:54:15.877 --> 00:54:18.254
-What did you say?
-A bolt of lightning.

00:54:18.337 --> 00:54:22.550
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:25.428
We do now.

00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:34.103
This is it! This is the answer.

00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:37.273
It says here that a bolt of lightning

00:54:37.356 --> 00:54:41.694
Is going to strike the clock tower
at precisely 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night!

00:54:45.239 --> 00:54:48.701
If we could somehow harness this lightning,

00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:53.122
channel it into the flux capacitor,

00:54:54.415 --> 00:54:56.209
it just might work.

00:54:56.501 --> 00:55:00.755
Next Saturday night,
we're sending you back to the future!

00:55:01.714 --> 00:55:03.591
Okay, all right. Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

00:55:03.674 --> 00:55:07.303
I can spend a week in 1955. I can hang out.
You can show me around.

00:55:07.386 --> 00:55:10.640
Marty, that is completely out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

00:55:10.723 --> 00:55:12.725
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.394
Anything you do can have
serious repercussions on future events.

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.230
Do you understand?

00:55:18.105 --> 00:55:20.066
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

00:55:20.691 --> 00:55:21.901
Marty,

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:25.780
have you interacted with anybody else today,
besides me?

00:55:27.573 --> 00:55:30.701
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

00:55:30.785 --> 00:55:34.705
Great Scott! Let me see
that photograph again of your brother.

00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:41.504
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

00:55:42.755 --> 00:55:45.967
MARTY: His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

DOC: Now remember.

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.858
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:03.192
If they don't meet, they won't fall in love,

00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:05.069
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

disappearing from that photograph.

you repair the damage, you'll be next.

-What did your mother ever see in that kid?
-I don't know, Doc.

00:56:49.238 --> 00:56:53.367
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

Hit me with the car.

It's a little bumpy.

DAVID: Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:31.945
second of all, somebody named Greg
or Craig called you just a little while ago.

01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:33.613
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

01:47:33.696 --> 01:47:36.407
I don't know!
I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

again last night?

Yeah. I...

01:47:47.543 --> 01:47:50.088
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:53.216
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office.

to know about these things?

See? There's Biff out there
waxing it right now.

Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get
two coats of wax this time, not just one.

you can accomplish anything.

you haven't seen me in a week.

I haven't.
