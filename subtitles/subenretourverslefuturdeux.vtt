McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker,
3793 Oakhurst Street, Hilldale, age 47.

00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.311
Forty-seven? That's a hell of a good face-lift.

00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:24.940
- What the hell are they doing, Doc?
- They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.650
Since her thumbprint
never changes over the years,

00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:28.861
they simply assume
she's the Jennifer of the future.

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.154
Well, we gotta stop them.

00:25:30.237 --> 00:25:33.240
What are we gonna say? That we're
time travelers? They'd have us committed.

00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:35.701
She's clean. That means we take her home.

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:39.079
Home? To Hilldale?
It'll be dark by the time we get out there.

00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:42.541
That's it. They're taking her home
to your future home!

00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:45.919
We'll arrive shortly thereafter,
get her out of there and go back to 1985.

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:48.881
You mean I'm gonna see where I live?
I'm gonna see myself as an old man?

00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:52.092
No, no, no, Marty. That could result in...
(GASPS) Great Scott!

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.304
Jennifer could conceivably encounter
her future self!

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:58.432
The consequences of that
could be disastrous!

00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:01.268
- Doc, what do you mean?
- I foresee two possibilities.

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:03.854
One, coming face to face
with herself 30 years older

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:06.065
would put her into shock,
and she'd simply pass out,

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:08.817
or two, the encounter could create
a time paradox,

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.570
the results of which could cause
a chain reaction that would unravel

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:15.657
the very fabric of the space-time continuum
and destroy the entire universe!

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.451
Granted, that's a worst-case scenario.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.161
The destruction might, in fact,
be very localized,

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:21.497
limited to merely our own galaxy.

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.249
Well, that's a relief.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.840
Let's go. I sure hope we find Jennifer
before she finds herself.

It's gonna take us forever to get there.

I didn't invent the time machine
to win at gambling.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.768

I know. I know. I know, Doc.

00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:58.534
So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:40.529
Daddy threw him out of the house.
Now, we can't get anybody to fix it.

Oh, look how worn out this is.

00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:46.451
Your father's biggest problem, Marlene,

00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:50.414
is that he loses all self-control
when someone calls him chicken.

00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:52.291
How many times have we heard it, George?

00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:55.961

- "Can't let them think I'm chicken."

You're right. Well, you're right!

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.925
OLDEST LORRAINE: About 30 years ago,
your father tried to prove he wasn't chicken,

00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:04.177
and he ended up in an automobile accident.

00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:05.595

That accident caused a chain reaction that
sent Marty's life straight down the tubes.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:21.713
If not for that accident, your father's life
would have turned out very differently.

00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:23.882
The man in the Rolls-Royce
wouldn't have pressed charges,

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.968
Marty wouldn't have broken his hand,
and he wouldn't have given up on his music,

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.971
and he wouldn't have spent all those years
feeling sorry for himself.

Hey, Mom, nice pants.

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.726
I think the real reason
your mother married him was because

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.478
- she felt sorry for him.
- "Mom"?

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.355

00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:43.986
And all the money in the world
wouldn't do jack shit for that lazy bum.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.197
Stop it, Biff. Just stop it.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.742
Look at him.
He's a butthead, just like his old man was.

00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.290
Don't you dare speak that way about George.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.211
You're not even half the man he was.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.004
(GRUNTS)

00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:04.215

- Hey.

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.222
OLDER BIFF: Always the little hothead, huh?

00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:19.313
You wanna take a poke at me?

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:22.650
(MAN LAUGHING)

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:25.528
Damn it, Biff. That's it. I'm leaving.

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:26.612
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

00:48:26.695 --> 00:48:29.323
So go ahead. But think about this, Lorraine!

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:33.327
Who's gonna pay for all your clothes, huh?
And your jewelry and your liquor?

00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:36.580
Who's gonna pay
for your cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?

00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:40.042
You were the one
who wanted me to get these things.

00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:43.421
If you want them back, you can have them.

00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:45.798
Look, Lorraine. You walk out that door,

00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:48.926
and I won't only cut off you.
I'll cut off your kids.

00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:51.762
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:55.057
First your daughter, Linda.
I'll cancel all her credit cards.

00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:57.643
She can settle her debts
with the bank all by herself.

00:48:57.726 --> 00:49:00.855
Your idiot son, Dave.
I'll get his probation revoked.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:03.023
And as for Marty.

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.943
Well, maybe you'd like to have
all three of your kids behind bars,

00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:08.112
just like your brother Joey.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:10.865
One big, happy, jailbird family.

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:17.204
All right, Biff. You win. I'll stay.

00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:24.795
As for you, I'll be back up here in an hour,
so you better not be.

00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:38.684
He was right, and I was wrong.

00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:42.771
Mom!

00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:45.733
Mom, what are you saying?
You're actually defending him.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:50.279
I had it coming. He's my husband,
and he takes care of all of us,

00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:53.908
- and he deserves our respect.
- (YELLING) Respect?

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:58.412
Your husband!
How could he be your husband?

00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:02.333
- How could you leave Dad for him?
- Leave Dad?

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:07.004
- Marty, are you feeling all right?
- No. No, I'm not feeling all right!

00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:09.632
I don't understand one damn thing
that's going on around here,

00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:12.593
and why nobody can give me a simple,
straight answer.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.721
Oh, they must have
hit you over the head hard this time.

00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:18.891
Mom, I just want to know one thing.

00:50:18.974 --> 00:50:21.977
Where's my father? Where's George McFly?

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:30.236
Marty, George, your father is in the same
place he's been for the past 12 years.

00:50:32.613 --> 00:50:34.573
Oak Park Cemetery.

No! This can't be happening!

No, please, God. Please, God, no.
This can't be happening.

00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:21.120
This can't be happening.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.331
This can't be...

00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:26.875
I'm afraid it is happening, Marty. All of it.

00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:28.460
Doc!

00:51:28.544 --> 00:51:31.422
When I learned about your father,
I figured you'd come here.

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:33.007
(WIND HOWLING)

00:51:33.966 --> 00:51:36.635
Then you know what happened to him?

00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:43.976
Do you know what happened
March 15, 1973?

00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:47.563
Yes, Marty. I know.

00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:51.483
DOC: I went to the public library
to try to make sense out of all the madness.

00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:53.152
The place was boarded up, shut down,

00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:55.154
so I broke in
and borrowed some newspapers.

00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:56.697
I don't get it, Doc.

00:51:56.905 --> 00:52:00.409
I mean, how can all this be happening?
It's like we're in hell or something.

00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:03.495
No, it's Hill Valley. Although,
I can't imagine hell being much worse.

(EINSTEIN WHIMPERING)

00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:08.292
Oh, Einie. I'm sorry, boy.

00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:12.379
The lab is an awful, awful, awful,
awful mess.

00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:15.049
Attaboy.

00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:18.969
Obviously, the time continuum
has been disrupted,

00:52:19.053 --> 00:52:21.472
creating this new temporal event sequence

00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:24.433
- resulting in this alternate reality.
- English, Doc.

00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:26.810
Here, here, here. Let me illustrate.

00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:35.653
Imagine that this line represents time.

00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:40.532
Here's the present, 1985,
the future and the past.

00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:45.412
Prior to this point in time,
somewhere in the past,

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:51.043
the timeline skewed into this tangent
creating an alternate 1985.

00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:54.922
Alternate to you, me and Einstein,

00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:58.467
but reality for everyone else.

00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:04.598
Recognize this?

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.892
It's the bag the sports book came in.

00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:09.853
I know, because the receipt was still inside.

00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:13.857
I found them in the time machine
along with this.

00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:23.200
It's the top of Biff's cane.
I mean, Old Biff from the future.

00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:25.244
Correct. It was in the time machine

00:53:25.327 --> 00:53:29.623
because Biff was in the time machine
with the sports almanac.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.375
Holy shit.

00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:35.838
You see, while we were in the future,
Biff got the sports book,

00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:38.257
stole the time machine, went back in time,

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.719
and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.181
Look. It says right here

00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:51.478
that Biff made his first million
betting on a horse race in 1958.

00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:53.397
He wasn't just lucky.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.984
He knew because he had all the race results
in the sports almanac.

00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:59.945
That's how he made his entire fortune.

00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:02.990
Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.

00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:06.994
The almanac.

00:54:07.828 --> 00:54:10.205
Son of a bitch stole my idea.

00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:13.333
He must have been listening when I...

00:54:15.294 --> 00:54:18.505
It's my fault. The whole thing is my fault.

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:22.217
If I hadn't bought that damn book,
none of this would have ever happened.

00:54:22.301 --> 00:54:24.595
- Well, it's all in the past.
- You mean the future?

00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:29.433
Whatever. It demonstrates precisely
how time travel can be misused

00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:32.644
and why the time machine
must be destroyed

00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:35.105
after we straighten all of this out.

00:54:35.189 --> 00:54:37.274
Right. So we go back to the future,

00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:39.485
and we stop Biff
from stealing the time machine.

00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:44.656
We can't, because if we travel
into the future from this point in time,

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:48.285
it will be the future of this reality,

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:54.249
in which Biff is corrupt and powerful
and married to your mother

00:54:54.333 --> 00:54:59.213
and in which this has happened to me.

(WHIMPERING)

No. Our only chance to repair the present
is in the past

at the point where the timeline
skewed into this tangent.

00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:17.981
In order to put the universe back
as we remember it

00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:20.400
and get back to our reality,

00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:24.196
we have to find out the exact date
and the specific circumstances

00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:29.618
of how, where and when Young Biff
got his hands on that sports almanac.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:33.580
I'll ask him.

All right. Take a seat.

00:56:56.997 --> 00:56:58.332
Sit down!

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:05.297
November 12, 1955. That was when.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.550
November 12, 1955.
That was the date I went back...

00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:13.889
That was the date
of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.

00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:17.726
You know your history. Very good.

00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.437
I'll never forget that Saturday.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.230
I'd just picked my car up from the shop,

00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:25.484
'cause I'd rolled it in a drag race
a few days earlier.

00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:28.195
I thought you crashed into a manure truck.

00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:32.157
How do you know about that?

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.369
- My father told me about it.
- Your father?

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.538
Before he died.

00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:41.083
Yeah. Right.

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:45.170

He says he's my distant relative.
I don't see any resemblance.

So he says,
"How would you like to be rich?"

00:57:57.808 --> 00:57:59.685
So I said, "Sure."

00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:06.483
So he lays this book on me.

00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.318
He says this book will tell me the outcome

and I'll never lose.

He says, "No catch. Just keep it a secret."

Oh, and he told me one more thing.

What if I don't?

Lead poisoning.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.330
What about the police, Biff?

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.874
They're gonna match up the bullet
with that gun.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.043
Kid, I own the police.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:36.383
Besides, they couldn't match up
the bullet that killed your old man.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.218
You son of a...

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:43.098
I suppose it's poetic justice.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:48.061
Two McFlys with the same gun.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.407
Idiot.

(GROANS)

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.128
Nice shot, Doc!

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.258
You're not gonna believe this.
We gotta go back to 1955.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.010
I don't believe it.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.857
MARTY: That's right, Doc. November 12, 1955.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.527
Unbelievable that Old Biff
could've chosen that particular date.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.653
It could mean that that point in time

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.364
inherently contains
some sort of cosmic significance,

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.366
almost as if it were
the temporal junction point

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.619
for the entire space-time continuum.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.580
On the other hand,
it could just be an amazing coincidence.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.123
(BEEPING)

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:55.503
Damn! Got to fix that thing.
All right. Time circuits on.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.632
What do you mean, time circuits on?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.468
- Doc, we're not going back now.
- Yep.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.303
Doc, what about Jennifer?
What about Einstein?

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.763
We can't just leave them here.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.973
Don't worry, Marty.
Assuming we succeed in our mission,

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:10.560
this alternate 1985 will be changed
back into the real 1985,

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.897
instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.523
Jennifer and Einie will be fine,

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.360
and they will have absolutely no memory
of this horrible place.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.903
Doc.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.322
What if we don't succeed?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.491
We must succeed.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.425
This is heavy, Doc.
I mean, it's like I was just here yesterday.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:45.595
You were here yesterday, Marty.
You were. Amazing, isn't it?

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.848
All right, sunrise should be
in about 22 minutes.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.227
You go into town.
Track down Young Biff and tail him.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:56.439
Sometime today, Old Biff will show up
to give Young Biff the almanac.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.608
Above all you, must not interfere
with that event.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.653
We must let Old Biff believe he's succeeded,
so that he'll leave 1955

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.114
- and bring the DeLorean back to the future.
- Right.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:07.325
Once Old Biff is gone,
grab the almanac any way that you can.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.577
Remember, both of our futures
depend on this.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.621
You don't have to remind me of that, Doc.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:16.293
Here's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie
so we can keep in contact.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.421
I'll stay here and try to repair the short
in the time circuit.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:22.299
That way, we don't risk anyone else
stealing the time machine,

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:26.678
and I won't risk
accidentally running into my other self.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:30.015
- Other self?
- Yes. There are now two of me here,

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.975
and there are two of you here.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:36.146
The other me is
the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955,

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:41.192
the younger me that helps the other you
get back to 1985.

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.570
Remember the lightning bolt
at the clock tower?

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.655
- Yeah.
- That event doesn't happen until tonight,

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.325
so you must be very careful
not to run into your other self.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.576
Let me give you some money.

Hey, Biff, she's all fixed up just like new,
but I couldn't get her started.

on this thing?

No, you just gotta have the right touch.

- The whole car was full of it.

We had to pay Old Man Jones 80 bucks
to haul it away.

- You want something for it?

We'll go inside. You can call Old Man Jones.
If he wants to give you a refund...
